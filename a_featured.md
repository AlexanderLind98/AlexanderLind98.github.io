		<p>I've worked most in Unreal Engine, since 2015 or so in fact, starting with UE4. Since then I've gone on to work in Unreal Engine 5, as well as graduating form just using Unreal Blueprints to using Unreal C++. I also work a lot in C# and Unity for school work, but for personal projects I prefer C++! This year, 2025, I've also started workin in Valve's Source Engine, coding in pure C++ for that.</p>
