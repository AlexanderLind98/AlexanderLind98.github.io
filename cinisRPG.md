    'CINIS - RPG' is my most recent and current solo project! Iterating upon the combat from my previous project, CINIS - Survivor. Over the span of ~2 months I have been upgrading and expanding the game to become a full role-playing game. Since it builds on a strong foundation of combat and visual assets, focus is on new mechanics and genre stables of roleplaying games. It adds things such as: <br>

        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Feature</th>
                    <th>Description</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>Expanded Inventory</td>
                    <td>Able to carry and replace weapons.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>NPCs</td>
                    <td>All with dialogue and unique looks.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Story & Cinematics</td>
                    <td>Finally expanding the world of CINIS with dialogue and visual storytelling.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Unique progression loops</td>
                    <td>Players don't collect XP to level up, they discover and complete challenges to gain new abilities and equipment!</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
            <tfoot>
                <tr>
                    <td colspan="2"></td>
                </tr>
            </tfoot>
        </table>
    </div>

    Nature of it being a solo project, most of the content is made by me, with help from testers and additional input. Look in game credits for more info!
