		My name is Alexander Møller Lind Jørgensen, but often I just use Alexander Lind internationally.<br>

		I've been making and learning to make games for the past 10 years, mostly in Unreal Engine. I am also very much familiar with C# and Unity however, and even more recently have gone deeper into learning C++ and working in other engines, mostly Valves Source Engine.<br><br>

		I am currently studying studying for a Bachelor's degree as a Software Engineer, as a top-up education for my AP in Computer Science. My entire education post elementary school has focused on game dev, as it is my hobby and passion to make games. Something about the way art and tech combines into creating one monolythic project has always appealed to me, ever since I was a little kid playing games on my Playstation 2.<br><br>

		My interest in art and tech is what got me into making games, and learning about all aspects of game development, and I always aim to learn more and get even better at my craft!<br><br>

		I live in Denmark, but since 2024 I've also spent quite a bit of time in Vancouver Canada, as I went there as a visiting student, as well as had my first internship there. Outside of that, I've also spent so much time there to be with my girlfriend, who lives in Vancouver as well. So for future job oppertunities, I am mostly seeking remote or possibly on-site in Vancouver as my ideal locations!
