My name is Alexander Møller Lind Jørgensen, but often I just use Alexander Lind internationally.

I've been making and learning to make games for the past 10 years,
mostly in Unreal Engine. I am also very much familiar with C# and Unity however, and even more recently have gone deeper into learning C++ and working in other engines,
mostly Valves Source Engine.

I have released 3 solo projects by now, most recently a prototype I am consitently updating, [CINIS - RPG](https://alexanderlind.itch.io/cinis-rpg). I have in addition to that released many other titles collaborating with classmates either from college, my AP in CS, or my current Bachelors degree.
