    (March, 2022)<br>
    A Unity game about dodging bombs and digging holes. Made in less than a month for a school assignment, during my time in college.

<p>
    'Bomb Survival' is a game which features both singleplayer mode, co-op mode, and versus mode. Originally, co-op was the only multiplayer intended to be added, but a playtest showed players really wanted to compete and fight against each other. <br><br> We worked with a somewhat large team for this project, 8 people in total, meaning we had very diverse and dedicated roles. For this project I acted as a secondary lead, as well as gameplay & level designer. On a technical front I did environment art, as well as coding different visual effects for the game.<br><br>

    Thanks to all who helped work on this game! It was a really fun experience to work on.
