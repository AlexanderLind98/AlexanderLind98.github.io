<p>
    'Rythm Robot' is a game developed with the intent to instigate flow-state in users. Medical research shows that flow-state can help reduce anxiety and increase focus. Therefore Digital Lab wished to create a Rythm / Runner game, as these rythm especially is showed to help increase the feeling of flow. The precise design mechanics and such were left vague, so it was up to me and my classmate Frederik to design and pitch the game.<br><br>

	The game is targeted towards mobile platforms, and therefore performance and ease of controls was obviously a huge consideration. For this project I worked mainly on player input, abilities, gamefeel and effects. Frederik implemented other core systems, such as a pattern editor, song BPM reader / modifier, and adaptive difficulty.<br><br>

    Thanks to Digital Lab for allowing us to work on this, and thanks to Frederik for another great project!
