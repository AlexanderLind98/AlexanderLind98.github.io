			<h2>About CINIS - SURVIVOR</h2>
		</header>

<p>
    'CINIS - SURVIVOR' is my second solo project, and first project made in mostly C++ to be released. Compared to previous attempts at making games, this had a much tighter scope, focusing only on combat and making everything really high quality before shipping. It would be just one arena, and focus would exclusivly be on making nice combat.<br><br>
    
    At one point there were perhaps ideas to extend it, but this was mostly shelved as I had other projects I wanted to work on, and diversify my portfolio more. Project also had the goal of finding a satisfying cross of graphics and low-fidelity retro aestethic, something which I believe I got down pretty well.<br><br>

    While technically a solo project, I had plenty of help from friends who helped workshop ideas and play test! A special thanks to my girlfriend, Cindy, for making the beautiful water shader for the project!
