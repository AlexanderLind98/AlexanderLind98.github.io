    Below is a short video from my early time in the project, showcasing some of the work I did that day to the rest of the team.

<p>
    'Vance' is an in-development Half-Life 2 mod. It has been in development for quite some time now, but recently restarted development with a new team. I joined the team as a programmer, but some of my work goes beyond just programming. My major contributions (this far) has been centered around adding / changing movement mechanics, as seen in the video above, modifying enemy AI from either base HL2, or continuing / altering work made by previous modders. I have also modified and bug fixed many of the games weapons.<br><br>
    
    For non-programming examples of work, I have drawn and implemented all weapon icons using vector graphocs and font generators to implement them, as Source games frequently makes use of TTF files for HUD icons. I have also contributed with some modeling work, and level design.<br><br>

    As mentioned, the game is in dev, and while there's not much to show just yet, I hope there'll be more in the future! The team is amazing and really talented, shout out to all of them and thanks to them for taking me on board!
