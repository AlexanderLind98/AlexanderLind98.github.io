<p>
    'SandScape' is a serious game and a literal Sandbox game. It is aimed at kids, and is meant to make sandtray therapy more accessible. The project was requested by Digital Lab. I helped develop the initial prototype all from scratch, during my stay as visiting student at the Center of Digital Media, from January - April in 2024. Later, from August - October 2024, I had my internship at Digital Lab, and helped further develop the prototype, adding new online functionality. The game can run on both Windows, Mac, and Web, as per the clients wishes. <br><br> Online features include: <br>

    <div class="table-wrapper">
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Feature</th>
                    <th>Description</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>Cloud Saving</td>
                    <td>The game could already save and load from a JSON file when run locally, but now any game instance could download a file using a unique file code.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Demo Recording</td>
                    <td>Any running instance of scene creation is "recorded", where every action and move is logged to a file. Later, these actions can be replayed in game, resulting in playback of a therapy session. This allows for lightweight and easy recording / playback of sessions without needing to review video files or have patients screen record sessions.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Data collection & Therapist menu</td>
                    <td>When therapists log into the app, they are provided with additional UI to check up on patients and review. Here they can retrieve their patients sessions, review used figures, length of session, and demo recording playback.</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
            <tfoot>
                <tr>
                    <td colspan="2"></td>
                </tr>
            </tfoot>
        </table>
    </div>

    During my internship, I also made many quality of life updates and changes, along with bug fixes.<br>
    <br>
    Original project was developed as a team of 6, and I give great thanks to my team members, Cindy, Claire, Carol, Lan and Mandy for a great experience and project!
