<p>
    'Bionicle: Destiny of the Toa' is a LEGO Bionicle fangame, which was made in a couple of weeks as a finals project during my AP in CS. It was made by me and 2 of my classmates. We had long joked about making our next game a procedurally generated RPG game, but we actually ended up doing it. I came up with the idea of lending the Bionicle franchise as the setting, and otherwise helped design the gameplay, make the art assets, direct the world generation (coded by my friend and teammate Frederik), and most importantly implement core combat and player systems such as mask powers, weapons, elemental attacks and more.<br><br>

    Many thanks to all who helped playtest and my amazing team for developing this game!
